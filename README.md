# jointfusion_hackathon
Ioint fusion DL model to predict ASD from structural and functional connectome brain features extracted form the ABIDE MRI and fMRI datasets.

The DL algorithm developed for the analysis of the ABIDE data (structural and fMRI) published in the paper Saponaro, S., Lizzi, F., Serra, G., Mainas, F., Oliva, P., Giuliano, A., Calderoni, S., & Retico, A. (2024). Deep learning based joint fusion approach to exploit anatomical and functional brain information in autism spectrum disorders. Brain Informatics, 11(1), 2. https://doi.org/10.1186/s40708-023-00217-4 has been revised to make it available as an exercise for the students of 1st AI-INFN Advanced Hackathon (Nev. 26-28 2024, Padova, Italy) https://fondazione-fair.it/evento/1st-ai-infn-advanced-hackathon/
